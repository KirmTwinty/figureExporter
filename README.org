* Usage
First you need to download and install the GUI Layout Toolbox at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox

Then you can execute the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirmTwinty/figureExporter/master/testme.m][/testme/]] file in Matlab to test the application. As you can see in this file, the tool only requires the handle to the axes you want to export as input. 

Basically, you can run the tool with the following command to export the current axes image.
#+BEGIN_SRC: matlab
FigExporter(gca);
#+END_SRC: matlab
