* Usage
First you need to download and install the GUI Layout Toolbox at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox

Then you can execute the /testme.m/ file in Matlab to test the application.

#+BEGIN_SRC: matlab
close all;
clear all;
clc;
addpath(); % Path to the layout toolbox

[X,Y] = meshgrid(-8:.5:8);
R = sqrt(X.^2 + Y.^2) + eps;
Z = sin(R)./R;

hFig = figure;
mesh(Z);
hAxes = gca;
FigExporter(hAxes);
#+END_SRC: matlab

As you can see in the /testme.m/ file, the tool only requires the handle to the axes you want to export as input.
